# LearningC
A repo for me to learn git whilst learning C

I have a similar repository on a different account but due to not wanting to use that account anymore I decided to make a new account. I just want a fresh start since im starting school soon and dont want to be dragged down. 

I have some experience with python but to be honest I wouldnt even call myself a programmer yet. Just some loser who wants to learn to code lol.
